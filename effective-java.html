            <h3>Effective Java</h3>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Joshua Bloch</p>
            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2017 (3rd Edition)</p>
            <p><strong>Pages:</strong> 412</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.9/5 (5,000 reviews)</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong>

                Since this Jolt-award winning classic was last updated in 2008, the Java programming environment has changed dramatically. Java 7 and Java 8 introduced new features and functions including, forEach() method in Iterable interface, default and static methods in Interfaces, Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions, Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections, Java Time API, Collection API improvements, Concurrency API improvements, and Java IO improvements.
                
                In this new edition of Effective Java, Bloch explores new design patterns and language idioms that have been introduced since the second edition was released in 2008 shortly after Java SE6, including Lambda, streams, generics and collections, as well as selected Java 9 features.
                
                As in previous editions, each chapter consists of several “items” presented in the form of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and updated code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why.
                
                    Updated techniques and best practices on classic topics, including objects, classes, libraries, methods, and serialization
                    How to avoid the traps and pitfalls of commonly misunderstood subtleties of the language
                    Focus on the language and its most fundamental libraries: java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.util.concurrent and java.io

            <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
            <p>THIS book is designed to help you make effective use of the Java programming
                language and its fundamental libraries: java.lang, java.util, and java.io, and
                subpackages such as java.util.concurrent and java.util.function. Other
                libraries are discussed from time to time.
                This book consists of ninety items, each of which conveys one rule. The rules
                capture practices generally held to be beneficial by the best and most experienced
                programmers. The items are loosely grouped into eleven chapters, each covering
                one broad aspect of software design. The book is not intended to be read from
                cover to cover: each item stands on its own, more or less. The items are heavily
                cross-referenced so you can easily plot your own course through the book.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: Creating and Destroying Objects</h2>
            <p>THIS chapter concerns creating and destroying objects: when and how to create
                them, when and how to avoid creating them, how to ensure they are destroyed in a
                timely manner, and how to manage any cleanup actions that must precede their
                destruction</p>

        <section id="chapter3">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Methods Common to All Objects</h2>
            <p>ALTHOUGH Object is a concrete class, it is designed primarily for extension.
                All of its nonfinal methods (equals, hashCode, toString, clone, and finalize)
                have explicit general contracts because they are designed to be overridden. It is
                the responsibility of any class overriding these methods to obey their general con-
                tracts; failure to do so will prevent other classes that depend on the contracts (such
                as HashMap and HashSet) from functioning properly in conjunction with the class.
                This chapter tells you when and how to override the nonfinal Object methods.
                The finalize method is omitted from this chapter because it was discussed in
                Item 8. While not an Object method, Comparable.compareTo is discussed in this
                chapter because it has a similar character.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4: Classes and Interfaces</h2>
            <p>CLASSES and interfaces lie at the heart of the Java programming language.
                They are its basic units of abstraction. The language provides many powerful
                elements that you can use to design classes and interfaces. This chapter contains
                guidelines to help you make the best use of these elements so that your classes and
                interfaces are usable, robust, and flexible.</p>

        <section id="chapter5">
            <h2>Chapter 5: Generics</h2>
            <p>SINCE Java 5, generics have been a part of the language. Before generics, you had
                to cast every object you read from a collection. If someone accidentally inserted an
                object of the wrong type, casts could fail at runtime. With generics, you tell the
                compiler what types of objects are permitted in each collection. The compiler
                inserts casts for you automatically and tells you at compile time if you try to insert
                an object of the wrong type. This results in programs that are both safer and clearer,
                but these benefits, which are not limited to collections, come at a price. This chap-
                ter tells you how to maximize the benefits and minimize the complications.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 6: Enums and Annotations</h2>
            <p>JAVA supports two special-purpose families of reference types: a kind of class
                called an enum type, and a kind of interface called an annotation type. This chap-
                ter discusses best practices for using these type families.</p>

        <section id="chapter7">
            <h2>Chapter 7: Lambdas and Streams</h2>
            <p>In Java 8, functional interfaces, lambdas, and method references were added to
                make it easier to create function objects. The streams API was added in tandem
                with these language changes to provide library support for processing sequences of
                data elements. In this chapter, we discuss how to make best use of these facilities</p>

            <h2>Chapter 8: General Programming</h2>
            <p>THIS chapter is devoted to the nuts and bolts of the language. It discusses local
                variables, control structures, libraries, data types, and two extralinguistic facilities:
                reflection and native methods. Finally, it discusses optimization and naming
                conventions.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 9: Exceptions</h2>
            <p>WHEN used to best advantage, exceptions can improve a program's readability,
                reliability, and maintainability. When used improperly, they can have the opposite
                effect. This chapter provides guidelines for using exceptions effectively.</p>

        <section id="chapter10">
            <h2>Chapter 10: Concurrency</h2>
            <p>THREADS allow multiple activities to proceed concurrently. Concurrent pro-
                gramming is harder than single-threaded programming, because more things can go
                wrong, and failures can be hard to reproduce. You can't avoid concurrency. It is
                inherent in the platform and a requirement if you are to obtain good performance
                from multicore processors, which are now ubiquitous. This chapter contains advice
                to help you write clear, correct, well-documented concurrent programs.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 11: Serialization</h2>
            <p>THIS chapter concerns object serialization, which is Java’s framework for
                encoding objects as byte streams (serializing) and reconstructing objects from
                their encodings (deserializing). Once an object has been serialized, its encoding
                can be sent from one VM to another or stored on disk for later deserialization. This
                chapter focuses on the dangers of serialization and how to minimize them.</p>
